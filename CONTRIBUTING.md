# Contributing Guidelines

Feel free to contribute.  Fork the repo, make some changes, open a pull request and I'll check it out.

Please try to keep changes small and well-organized, so that I have an easier time reviewing them.

Also feel free to open an issue if something isn't right.

## Code Style

Use Prettier for formatting. This project uses the default settings, with one exception: `trailingCommas` is set to `all`.

You can run it [from your code editor](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html), or from the command line:

```console
npx prettier --write
```

Consistent code style is good.  Automatically enforced code style is even better.
