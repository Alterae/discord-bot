# Contributing Guidelines

Feel free to contribute.  Fork the repo, make some changes, open a pull request and I'll check it out.

Please try to keep changes small and well-organized, so that I have an easier time reviewing them.

Also feel free to open an issue if something isn't right.

## Code Style

Use Prettier for formatting, with trailing commas set to always.

Consistent code style is good.  Automatically enforced code style is even better.
