# discord-bot

Just another discord bot. Have fun.

To compile and run the bot:

```console
npm start
```

## Planned Commands

- `version` - show the package version of the bot
- `about` - show info about the bot (name, version, GitHub repo, description, etc.)
- `help` - help command, self-explanatory
- More to come!

## Planned features

- Object-based command system supporting aliases and taking full advantage of typescript's type system.
- Command parser supporting quoted arguments and (rudimentary) flags (like most command-line apps)
- An option (maybe via a `--no-embed` flag) to fall back to regular text instead of using embeds.
- More to come!
